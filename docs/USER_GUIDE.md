# R-Shop User Guide

R-Shop is a retro game manager with a console-style UI. It organizes, downloads, and manages ROM files from your own servers and network shares, with full gamepad and keyboard support.

**R-Shop is not an emulator.** It is a file management tool for browsing, downloading, and organizing game files. To play games, use a separate emulator such as RetroArch, Dolphin, PPSSPP, or any other emulator of your choice.

> **Legal Notice:** R-Shop does not host, distribute, or link to copyrighted game files. Users are responsible for providing their own legally obtained files. Supported sources include personal backups of owned cartridges and discs, homebrew games, public domain ROMs, and legally purchased digital copies.

## Getting Started

On first launch, R-Shop walks you through a 7-step onboarding process to configure your game sources.

### Step 1: Welcome

A greeting from the app mascot. Press A to continue.

### Step 2: Legal Notice

You must acknowledge that you are responsible for owning legal copies of any game files you manage with R-Shop.

### Step 3: RomM Setup (Optional)

If you run a [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) server on your network, you can connect it here:

1. Enter your RomM server URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:8080`)
2. Provide authentication: API key or username/password
3. Press Y to test the connection
4. Select which platforms to import from the server
5. Choose a local folder where ROM files will be stored

If you don't use RomM, select "No" to skip this step and proceed to Local Setup instead.

### Step 4: Local Setup (Optional)

If you skipped RomM, this step helps you set up local ROM folders:

- **Auto-detect**: R-Shop scans for existing ROM directories on your device
- **Create folders**: Generate a standard folder structure for all supported systems
- **Pick folder**: Manually select an existing folder to scan

Detected folders are automatically matched to systems. You can toggle systems on or off, and manually assign any unmatched folders.

### Step 5: Console Setup

The main configuration screen. A grid displays all supported systems. For each console you can:

- Set a **target folder** where ROM files will be stored
- Toggle **auto-extract** for archive files (off by default — zipped libraries stay packed unless you opt in)
- Toggle **merge mode** to combine results from multiple providers
- Toggle **auto-sync on app launch** to control whether this system syncs automatically (respects the cooldown setting) or only manually via the quick menu
- **Add providers** (Web, SMB, FTP, or RomM) with connection details

Press Y to add a new provider, then fill in the type-specific fields and test the connection. You can add multiple providers per console and reorder their priority.

At least one console must be configured before you can proceed.

### Step 6: RetroAchievements (Optional)

If you have a [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org) account, you can connect it to track achievement progress and verify your ROMs:

1. Select "Yes, connect my account" (or "No, skip" to proceed without RA)
2. Enter your RA username
3. Enter your API key (found at retroachievements.org/controlpanel.php)
4. Press Y to test the connection

On success, R-Shop will sync achievement data for supported systems in the background. You can always set this up later in Settings.

### Step 7: Complete

A summary of your configured consoles. Press Select to export your configuration as a JSON backup file, then press A to enter the app.

**You can always reconfigure consoles and providers later from Settings.**

---

## Home Screen

The home screen displays your configured systems.

### Carousel Mode (Default)

Swipe or use the D-pad to scroll through system cards. Each card shows the console name, manufacturer, and release year. Press A to enter a system.

### Grid Mode

Toggle via Settings. Systems display in a grid layout. Adjust columns with L1 (more columns) and R1 (fewer columns).

### Library Card

A special card appears between your systems, providing access to the cross-system Library browser.

### Download Badge

A pulsing indicator in the top-left corner appears when downloads are active.

### Quick Menu

Press Start to open the quick menu with options for:

- **Search** — jump to game search
- **Sync [System Name]** — sync the currently selected system (shows last sync time as subtitle; only shown when a system is selected)
- **Sync All** — force a full sync of all configured systems regardless of cooldown (shown when multiple systems are configured)
- **Settings** — open app settings
- **Downloads** — view download queue (shown when queue has items)

### Exiting

Press B on the home screen to show an exit confirmation dialog.

---

## Browsing Games

Selecting a system from the home screen opens the game list.

### Layout

Games display as a grid of cover art. Adjust columns with L1 (more, 3-8 range) and R1 (fewer). The header shows the system logo, total game count, a local-only indicator (if no remote providers), and the target folder path.

The background dynamically shows the selected game's cover art, tinted with the system's color.

### Search

Press Y to open the search overlay. Type to filter games in real time by name. Press Down or B to exit search and return to the grid.

### Filters

Press X to cycle through filter options:

- **Region** — show only games from selected regions (OR logic)
- **Language** — show only games in selected languages (OR logic)
- **Favorites Only** — show only games you have favorited
- **Local Only** — show only games installed on your device

Games with no region or language metadata pass through those filters. Your filter choices are saved per system.

### Game Grouping

Games with the same name but different versions (e.g. USA, Europe, Japan) are grouped together. Selecting a group opens the Game Detail screen where you can pick a specific variant.

---

## Game Detail

The detail screen shows a game's cover art, title, system badge, and — for RomM sources — rich metadata including genre, developer, release year, and summary in an "About This Game" card.

### About This Game

When a game has IGDB metadata (available via RomM), a glassmorphic info card displays genre pills, developer, release year, and a short summary. Open the full description from the quick menu (Start > Description).

### Variants

If multiple versions of a game exist (different regions, languages, or releases), pressing A opens a **variant picker overlay** listing all versions with their region, language, format, and install status. Navigate with D-pad up/down, press A to download or delete a specific variant, press B to close.

### RetroAchievements Info

If the game has a RetroAchievements match, an info section appears below the metadata showing the match type (name match or hash verified), achievement count, and your progress. Press Start and select "Achievements" from the quick menu to open the full achievements screen.

### Actions

| Action | Button | Condition |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Download | A | Single variant, not installed |
| Delete | A | Single variant, installed |
| Pick Version | A | Multiple variants |
| Favorite | Select | Toggle anytime |
| Add/Remove Shelf | Select menu or Start menu | Add to or remove from custom shelves |
| Quick Menu | Start | Tags, Description, Filename, Achievements, Download sources, Shelf management |

### Download

Pressing A on an uninstalled single-variant game adds it to the download queue. For multi-variant games, A opens the variant picker where you can download individual versions.

### Delete

Pressing A on an installed single-variant game opens a confirmation dialog. The dialog defaults to **Cancel** to prevent accidental deletion. For multi-variant games, select a variant in the picker and press A to delete it.

---

## Library

The Library provides a cross-system view of all your games. Access it from the Library card on the home screen.

### Tabs

Switch tabs with L2 (left) and R2 (right):

| Tab | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| All | Every game in your database |
| Installed | Only games with local files |
| Favorites | Games you have favorited |

### Sorting

Press X to cycle between sort modes:

- **Alphabetical** — A to Z by display name
- **By System** — grouped by console, then alphabetical

### Search

Press Y to open the search bar. Type to filter by game name in real time.

### Grid

Navigate the game grid with the D-pad. Adjust columns with L1/R1 (range: 3-8). Press A to open a game's detail screen.

---

## RetroAchievements

R-Shop integrates with [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org) to display achievement data, verify ROMs, and track your progress.

### Setup

Connect your RA account during onboarding or later via Settings > RetroAchievements. You need your username and API key (found at retroachievements.org/controlpanel.php).

### How It Works

After connecting, R-Shop runs a background sync in three phases:

1. **Catalog fetch** — downloads the RA game catalog for each supported system (cached for 24 hours)
2. **Name matching** — matches your local games to RA entries by title (exact, contains, No-Intro filename, or fuzzy matching)
3. **Hash verification** — computes ROM hashes for installed games and verifies them against the RA database

When you download a new ROM, it is automatically hashed and matched after the download completes.

### Game Cards

Games with RA matches display a badge on their card:

| Badge Color | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| Gold | Name-matched (title matched, ROM not yet hash-verified) |
| Green | Hash-verified (ROM confirmed via MD5 hash) |
| Green outline | Mastered (all achievements earned) |

The badge shows the number of achievements available for the game.

### Achievements Screen

Open the achievements screen from a game's detail view via the quick menu (Start > Achievements). The screen shows:

- Game icon and title with completion percentage
- Progress bar (earned / total achievements)
- "MASTERED" label when all achievements are earned
- Full achievement list with badge icons, descriptions, point values, and earn dates
- Navigate with D-pad up/down, press B to go back

### Supported Systems

RetroAchievements data is available for: NES, SNES, N64, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, NDS, Mega Drive, Master System, Game Gear, Sega 32X, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, and Atari Lynx.

### Settings

The RA config screen (Settings > RetroAchievements) provides:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Test Connection (Y) | Verify credentials against the RA API |
| Enable/Disable | Toggle RA data display on game cards |
| Refresh Database | Force a full RA catalog re-sync |
| Clear Cache | Remove all cached RA data |
| Save (Start) | Persist credential changes |
| Clear (X) | Reset all fields |

---

## Provider Setup Guide

Providers are the sources R-Shop fetches game files from. Each console can have multiple providers. Configure them during onboarding or later via Settings > Edit Consoles.

### Web Provider

An HTTP server with directory listing enabled.

**Configuration:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| URL | Yes | Base URL of the server |
| Path | No | Subdirectory within the URL |
| Username | No | HTTP Basic Auth username |
| Password | No | HTTP Basic Auth password |

**Example:** `http://192.168.1.100/roms/nes/`

**Requirements:** The server must serve an HTML page with directory listing (clickable file links). Works with nginx autoindex, Apache directory listing, and simple HTTP file servers.

### SMB Provider (Network Share)

A Windows or Samba file share on your local network.

**Configuration:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Host | Yes | Server IP or hostname |
| Share | Yes | Share name |
| Path | No | Subdirectory within the share |
| Username | No | Defaults to `guest` |
| Password | No | Defaults to empty |
| Domain | No | Windows domain |

**Example:** Host `192.168.1.50`, Share `games`, Path `NES`

**Note:** SMB always uses port 445. If no credentials are provided, guest access is attempted.

### FTP Provider

A standard FTP server.

**Configuration:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Host | Yes | Server IP or hostname |
| Port | No | Defaults to 21 |
| Path | No | Remote directory (defaults to `/`) |
| Username | No | Defaults to `anonymous` |
| Password | No | Defaults to empty |

**Example:** Host `192.168.1.100`, Port `21`, Path `/roms/snes`

**Note:** Anonymous login is used when no credentials are provided. Connection timeout is 30 seconds. Directory listing operations allow up to 60 seconds.

### RomM Provider

Integration with a self-hosted RomM game library server.

**Configuration:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Server URL | Yes | Your RomM instance URL |
| API Key | No* | Bearer token for API access |
| Username | No* | Basic auth username |
| Password | No* | Basic auth password |

*Provide either an API key or username/password for authentication.

**Example:** URL `https://192.168.1.100:8080`, API key `your-api-key`

**Benefits:** RomM provides organized metadata, cover art, and a structured library. Requires a running RomM instance on your network.

### Multi-Provider and Merge Mode

Each console can have multiple providers with a priority order (lower number = tried first).

**Failover (default):** Providers are tried in priority order. The first successful connection provides the game list.

**Merge Mode:** Results from all providers are combined and deduplicated by filename. Useful when different servers host different regions or versions.

---

## Downloads

R-Shop uses a queue system for managing file downloads.

### Queue Behavior

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Concurrent downloads | Up to 3 (default: 2, configurable in Settings) |
| Auto-retry | Up to 3 attempts per file |
| Retry backoff | 5s, 15s, 45s (with random jitter up to 3s) |
| Non-retryable errors | 404 Not Found, SSL errors |
| Progress updates | Every 500ms with speed (KB/s) and percentage |
| Inactivity timeout | 60 seconds of no data received |
| HTTP timeouts | 30s connection, 5 min idle |
| FTP timeouts | 30s connection, 60s directory listing |
| SMB timeout | 30s connection |

### Persistence

The download queue survives app restarts. Active downloads resume from the queue on next launch.

### Archive Extraction

ZIP files are extracted automatically only when the system has auto-extract enabled. Auto-extract is **off by default** so existing zipped libraries are not unpacked. Multi-file games (e.g. PlayStation .bin/.cue pairs) are extracted into subfolders, preserving the file structure.

Multi-file games (bin/cue pairs) can also be downloaded as complete folders directly via SMB and FTP providers, without needing archives.

7z archives are moved directly without extraction.

### Limitations

There is no pause/resume for individual downloads. Cancelling a download means it must restart from the beginning.

### Download Badge

A pulsing badge on the home screen indicates active downloads. The quick menu (Start) shows a Downloads option when the queue has items.
